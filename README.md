# Hotel-Booking-with-Causal-Inference

Estimating the impact of assigning a different room as compared to what the customer had reserved on Booking Cancellations.

The dataset contains booking information for a city hotel and a resort hotel taken from a real hotel in Portugal, and includes information such as when the booking was made, length of stay, the number of adults, children, and/or babies, and the number of available parking spaces, among other things. All personally identifying information has been removed from the data.
